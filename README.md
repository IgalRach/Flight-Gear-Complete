# Flight-Gear-Complete Project

## Summary

In this video, during our advanced software development course taught by Dr. Eli Khalastchi, we created a user interface to control an aircraft in FlightGear Simulator. 
Server side -We worked with Java programming language which emphasis on design patterns and programming principles such as SOLID and GRASP.
Also, we used algorithm to calculate the shortest path to our destination (BFS and A star).
Client side - We worked with JavaFX  for a desktop application using the MVVM architecture.
